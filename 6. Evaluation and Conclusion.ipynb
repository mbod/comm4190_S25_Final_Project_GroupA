    "- The Co-Pilot was very perceptive to each of our concerns, prefences, and requirements\n",
    "- Even though we started off coding it to help plan out courses for 3 inteded majors and 1 minor, the Co-Pilot essentially is able to help plan course schedules for any combination of major and minor now, along with specific requests (such as advanced level courses for a senior)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Since the full list of Penn's current course offerings is only accessible with a Pennkey login, it is not possible for our Co-Pilot to go directly into path@penn to take into consideration different choices in professors or times for each course\n",
    "- Some classes that are typically listed under one semester could be discontinued or not offered in a specific semester, which the Co-Pilot again would not have access to know about  \n",
