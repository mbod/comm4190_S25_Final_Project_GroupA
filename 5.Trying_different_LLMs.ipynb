    "### Prompting different LLM's to become Penn CAS Co-pilots and testing there ability\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes a comparison of several large language models (LLMs) and evalutes their appropriateness for helping the Course Planner Co-Pilot's academic advising capabilities. We test how well each model understands and responds to academic planning queries, respects prompt boundaries, and handles conversation focus in controlled experiments. These experiments help us demonstrate that the Co-Pilot has the ability to create recommendations appropriate to students' academic goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also investigates how the various models handle off-topic requests  designed to be distractions. These experiments are critical to test our prompt engineering and how the models deal with detecting and rejecting useless asks. The insights from the experiments help us understand which LLMs possess the ideal level of responsiveness at the cost of staying on task, making them a better candidate for being a Co-pilot."

    "\n",
    "As explored in Notebooks 1–4, our AI Planner Co-Pilot was designed with a structured understanding of Penn’s curriculum, allowing it to support multi-program students through complex academic trajectories. In this section, we evaluate how three public LLMs—***Claude, Gemini, and Deepseek***—perform on the same advising scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than rebuild redundant scaffolding, we begin here where the prior notebooks leave off: having implemented a prompt interface, structured user input, and course requirement ingestion, we now shift to benchmarking our system against alternative language models on a standardized advising task.\n",

This ability to exploit dual-counting between majors (not just within one department) is rare among LLMs and demonstrates a nuanced understanding of Penn’s offerings.\n"

    "### ⚙️ Additional Findings\n",
    "#### 🔄 Scalability Failure with Additional CSVs\n",
    "When we attempted to **expand the planner’s capabilities by adding more majors/minors** (e.g., adding History, PPE, or Visual Studies CSVs), **all three models broke down**. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Claude** became verbose but non-specific, often defaulting to vague reassurances like “that could be possible.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gemini** increased hallucination frequency dramatically—suggesting entire sets of fake courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deepseek** collapsed into repetition loops or invented course numbers across departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Implication:** None of the public LLMs can **scale beyond 3–4 CSV-loaded programs** without losing structural integrity. This directly contrasts with our planner’s architecture, which allows modular ingestion—simply adding a CSV enables instant support for a new major/minor without prompt degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Subsection: Long-Context Degradation\n",
    "In tests where interactions extended past 10+ turns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Claude** maintained the best memory but began simplifying its reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gemini** exhibited increasing hallucination and redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deepseek** began repeating itself and suggesting inconsistent pathways (e.g., recommending a course both in Junior Spring and Study Abroad)\n",
    "\n",
    "📉 This suggests that none of the models maintain **multi-turn consistency** when the academic plan becomes deeply entangled—especially across semesters, constraints, and triple-major logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎓 Subsection: Policy Awareness\n",
    "Only **Claude** showed even partial awareness of Penn’s credit cap, double-counting rules, or course availability constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini and Deepseek consistently:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recommended 6-course semesters without warning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ignored the fact that not all courses are offered every semester\n",
    "\n",
    "- Failed to respect prerequisites in course ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ These oversights could have serious consequences in real advising situations, reinforcing the need for hard-coded policy integration in academic LLM tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📍 **Conclusion**\n",
    "Across the board, Claude was the **most structured and realistic**, though still imperfect. Gemini was stylistically strong but **deeply unreliable**, and Deepseek showed the most promise in student-centered advising while **struggling with factual control.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The clear limitation of all three: **scalability, consistency, and trustworthiness** degrade sharply under pressure. In contrast to our own Co-Pilot, which scales linearly with CSV additions, the generalist models falter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reinforces the broader point: LLMs without hard-coded curriculum logic, memory control, and institutional policy grounding may be great chat partners—but they're not academic co-pilots.\n"
