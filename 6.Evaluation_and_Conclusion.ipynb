    "## Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Co-Pilot was very perceptive to each of our concerns, prefences, and requirements\n",
    "- Even though we started off coding it to help plan out courses for 3 inteded majors and 1 minor, the Co-Pilot essentially is able to help plan course schedules for any combination of major and minor now, along with specific requests (such as advanced level courses for a senior)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons:\n",
    "- Since the full list of Penn's current course offerings is only accessible with a Pennkey login, it is not possible for our Co-Pilot to go directly into path@penn to take into consideration different choices in professors or times for each course\n",
    "- Some classes that are typically listed under one semester could be discontinued or not offered in a specific semester, which the Co-Pilot again would not have access to know about  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Overall Thoughts:\n",
    "We are very pleased with our course planner co-pilot! We were very happy to see it surpass expected limitations to the majors/minor we chose, and be able to plan courses for any student at penn when given the list of requirements and such. We believe that this model can be further developed by Penn to have access to all penn-materials (Path@penn, courses@penn, etc.) and be a truly useful tool in helping undergraduates plan out their four years on campus.
