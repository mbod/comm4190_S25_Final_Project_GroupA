----
We are interested in using LLM capabilities to help assist students in their course planning journeys. While there is currently a lot of information online about different classes, the sources of information are often scattered and hard to consolidate together, and advising is also difficult to use consistently. As such, we see this gap between resources and planning as something that could be easily bridged by using the power of AI and LLMs.

In our project, we will attempt to train LLM by both using prompting and uploading information about course requirements and planning, so that the final product is a Course Planner Co Pilot that students can use readily to make it easier.


### User scenarios
1. CAS Junior doing a CIMS Major is selecting classes for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 and wants to make sure they complete all requirements of major to graduate
2. Wharton Sophomore doing a Data Science and Analytics minor and wants to plan out the 6 courses they will take to fulfill this minor
3. CAS Freshman weighs 2 different majors and wants the LLM to compare the two to help decide what courses they would be more interested in taking 
4. CAS Sophomore doing an Economics major wondering if they can study abroad junior year and still complete their concentration
5. CAS Freshman asking if taking PHIL 008 fulfills both the Sector 2 and Ethics requirement
