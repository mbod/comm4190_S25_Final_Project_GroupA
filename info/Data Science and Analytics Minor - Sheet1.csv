Data Science and Analytics Minor,,
,,
"Data science is the study of methods for extracting knowledge from data, combining programming, statistical, and communication skills. The Data Science & Analytics minor is intended for students who wish to complement their major field of study with data science skills. Students will learn the foundational data and programming tools, fundamental statistical inference methods, and modern machine learning approaches â€“ with a focus on application in the social and natural sciences. The minor consists of six courses, three of which are foundational and must fall into specific components (data and programming, statistics, applied data science) and the remaining three are electives that must have a strong link to data science. The minor is not exclusive to a single department, but rather recognizes the wide range of data science courses available in SAS and helps students organize their coursework into a focused data science minor.",,
